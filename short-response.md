1. We created a branch because branches continue working without affecting the main branch.

2. Developers use branches because on the main branch it's easier to make a terrible mistake and mess everything up than on the branch.

3. git is a command line tool that allows you to track and manage changes to your code and github is a cloud based service that allows developers to store track manage and control changes to their code. They work together by that github is used for collaborating and git is used on github to help manage the repository.

4. It is wrong because it is not in the correct order and the correct order is git add . git commit -m "saving work" and git push.
